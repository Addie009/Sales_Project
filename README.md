# Sales_Project 
# Introduction

In this project, I analysed a dataset with three different Product categories across six different countries.

# About the Dataset:

Has over 113,000+ records of orders of quantities purchased over the period of six years

Consist of the unit cost per product, the unit cost per profit, the total revenue and the total profit over time.

# Process of Cleaning the Dataset

I got the dataset from kaggle.com and loaded it to Excel, checked for duplicates by using the duplicate icon and had to filter the data by using the filter icon to check for missing or blank rows in the dataset. 
Used the IF statement to create a new column by grouping the age of the customers from Young to Senior and also used the IF statement to create a new column for gender. 

After checking for duplicates, missing values and blank rows, I was left with about 112,000 rows. The dataset is well structured. 

# Problem Statement

In this analysis, we will cover the following research questions:

WHAT IS THE TOTAL REVENUE AGAINST THE TOTAL PROFIT GENERATED?

WHICH YEAR HAD THE HIGHEST REVENUE GENERATED OVER THE PERIOD OF SIX YEARS?

WHICH COUNTRY HAS THE HIGHEST REVENUE?

WHICH PRODUCT CATEGORY HAD THE HIGHEST REVENUE GENERATED OVER THE PERIOD OF SIX YEARS?

WHICH SUB-PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED THE MOST OVER THE PERIOD OF SIX YEARS?

# Key Sales Insights

To improve overall efficiency, it is important to address the reasons why the company didn't operate for the full year in 2014 and 2016. The firm should focus on operating full for the next fiscal year.

Noticed the total cost is more than the total profit, it is important for the company to either reduce their unit cost per product or try to focus on selling more of the other products.

To improve the total profit over time, it is important to do more marketing strategy for Clothing and Accessories. 

The firm should consider conducting customer satifaction suverys and implementing measures to improve the ordering and delivery for customers on both Clothing and Accessories, that would generate more revenue and enhance the total profit
